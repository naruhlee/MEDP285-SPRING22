        <h1>  Naraly Ortega  </h1>
        <p> Hello! Now that you know my name I would like to tell you more about me.</p> <br>
        <p> Queens, New York is where I was born and raised. I am daughter to Ecuadorian Immigrant Parents. I was raised both in Astoria and Jamaica (Queens).<br>
            My favorite things about my borough is the culture, the diversity and the feeling of home. <br>
        <p> Since I could remember I had a passion for cool one-of-kind art and clothing. Art has been a big part of my life. <br>
            During my teens years, I let go of that part of myself, until now. Now I learned how to use my love for art in the modern tech world. </p> <br>
        <p> I am the middle child out of six children. My personality has always led me to be independent, kind and artistic. Like many students, I came into college confused about my future <br>
            I had my galbladder removed when I was 16 (Unsure if that is TMI). But, that event is what brought me here. After my surgery, I was convinced I wanted to be a nurse. <br>
            I imagined my life being a nurse, I was prepared for the long shifts and no matter what people told me, I persisted. <br>
            Long story short, I am taking organic chemistry and I realize nursing isn't something I am passionate about. <br>
            I am given advice and am told to take Media Studies (My initial plan was to be in Marketing). Now I realize that, Marketing is still my interest but I enjoy Media more. <br>
            I get to be creative while learning technical skills. <br> </p>
